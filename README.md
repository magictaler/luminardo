An open source Arduino-like hardware project with modular architecture and compact dimentions with the following features in base configuration:

- 8 digits by 6 segments VFD display;
- IR receiver;
- Photocell for brightness adjustmens;
- Buzzer;
- RGB LED with individual colors controlled independently by PWM;
- Single (either 5VDC or 12VDC) power supply;
- Lithium battery bucked up RTC;
- 1 Wire temperature sensor (with capability to connect more than one);
- USB Host functionality*;
- USB-to-Serial interface for progamming and debugging;
- 128 kb of program memory, 3.3V internal supply and logic levels;
- 5V tolerant ISP header; 
- I2C, secondary UART, secondary SPI for future extentions;
- PIR sensor;
- Integration with Arduino IDE;

* Firmware is tightly intergared with an awesome "Revision 2.0 of USB Host Library for Arduino" (thank you guys!)
